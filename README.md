    I'm currently working on Linux System Administration and Cybersecurity.

    I enjoy collaborating on projects that aim to make the world a better place, and I'm always open to contributing scripts and promoting free and open source software.

    If you need help with my scripts or want to discuss the promotion of free software, I'm here to help!

    Ask me about anything! If I know the answer, I'll tell you. If I don't, I'll learn, and we'll talk again in the future! 😉

    ;)
